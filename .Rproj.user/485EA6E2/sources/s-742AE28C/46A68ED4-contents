Hello, my name is Stephen York and this is my personal site where I discuss my thoughts data science, economics, and other topics that are on my mind. To give you some background about myself, I graduated from The George Washington University with a B.A. in International Affairs and Economics. After graduating, I started working at my current job - an Economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I am also a part-time graduate student earning my M.S. in Applied Economics at John's Hopkins University.
